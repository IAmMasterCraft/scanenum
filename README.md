# scanenum
scanenum is a compact Bash reconnaissance script that automates an initial web assessment workflow. It runs an aggressive nmap scan, performs directory bruteforce with Gobuster while filtering noisy 403s, and runs Nikto. It outputs a concise, deduplicated summary showing only High and Medium findingsâ€”ideal for quick triage and shareable reports. v1
